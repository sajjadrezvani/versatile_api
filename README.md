## Summary

Adding every car to the programmer device, is a huge issue for engineers. They have lots of trouble in this proccess. Becuase an emulator which contains the request of diag device and ECU response is nasty file. It contains lots of repeatetative lines or charaters and needs to be preproccessed before using for exact data and add to the programmer device. Before programming this api this proccess was perfomed by company engineers and wastea lots of their time and efforts. So this program removes all the abundant lines in emulator file and performs some cleaning on the file to become the proccess faster and more precise.
